Hey all I couldn't get the on-line version of RealityU's software to work even with eclipse but I can get the desktop version to work so maybe in class we could fix it if I cant by then. I threw some questions together just to get things rolling and as I
diagnose the software more tonight ill add more to the questions.

 <-------- Freelancers Questions -------->
 
	Color scheme and maybe even the GUI is not appealing to the targeted audience.
	See if the it is possible to get a sever donated to the non-profit the matches the criteria for the government standers for security. 
	Ask if the company is willing to spend the money yearly for the SSL certificate.
	If the software works well enough and would like us to just get working on the net version what are some key things they what working first...and of course we can only do so much in one semester.
	Possible to give each school a copy of the free software and just get the school participating in the event to get the volunteers for the event that way the school and run and have the event whenever.
